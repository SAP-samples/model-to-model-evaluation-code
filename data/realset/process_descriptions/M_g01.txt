Title: Instruct an artist to create a 3D model print it on a 3D printer

When craving a custom 3D model, as a first step you have to instruct an artist
to create a project for you.  First you have to send him several sketches, and
then tell him what to change until you are satisfied with the result. After
that, you choose a plastic color you want to use for 3D printing. If you have
the color at home (in stock), you check how much color you have left. If it's
under 100 grams, you put it on your shopping list. If you do not have the color
at home, you order it. When you have the plastic, you can turn the printer on
and heat up the bed and the extruder (it continuously sends you back its
status). While doing that, you can generate the gcode file for your printer out
of the STL sent to you by the artist. After that you print the model.
